# Blazor WebAssembly Apps

- STandalone Apps those executed in Browser
- .NET Runtine is Downloaded in the browser
- balzor.webassembly.js is the JSOM that interacts between Blazor and Browser
- Microsoft.NetCore.App
	- .NET Runtie that will be loaded in browser for WASM app execution
	- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly
		- PAckage that hosts and executes "Components(?)" in Browser
- Component
	- AN AUtonomous Object with FOllowing
		- UI
			- How the Component will be SHown on Browser
		- Data
			- What data will be presented to ENd-User or Acceted fro End-User
		- Behavior
			- What EVents are hosted by the Component 
		- Logic
			- What logic is provided to the Component
	- Componet is a 'RazorComponent' file added into the Project
		- E.g. MyComponent.razor
			- @page "/mycomponent"
				- Directive, this will be used to navigate to tyhe Component
			- MyComponent will be the NAme of the Component and it will be used as CUSTOM HTML Element as follows
				- MyComponent MyComponent
					- THis will load the Component Class, with its UI, Data, Behavior and Logic
	- COmponent
		- USe this as a SIgnle Functional UI Element e.g. CRUD operations by making HTTP Call
		- USe this as a Re-Usable Custom Element	
			- E.g.  Create a ReUsabe Table for showing Employees, Products, Orders, etc.
				- e.g.
					- TableComponent TableComponent
- Standard Components
	- Input
		- InputText
		- InputNumber
		- Select
- Adding New Custom Component
	- Right-Click on Pages Folder and Add -> Razor Components
	- The Lifecycle Methods(?) of Component
- DataBinding
	- Expose the Data Member to UI Elements to Present data to UI
	- USed to Accept data from UI and Update the Data member
	- @bind-Value
		- THis is used for Two-Way Databinding
		- If Data is changed the UI will change and if UI is change data will change
		- InputText @bind-Value="EmpNo" InutText
			- WHen the Data is entered in Text element, the 'change' event will be detected by @bind-Value
			- @bind-Value will read the latest value entered in Text element and accodingly Update the Data proeprty bind to it
		- @onclik, a click evet on the button elements those are bound to methd of the component 
			- input type="button" @onclick="fn()"
				- fn() is a method of the mcomponent, this will be inoked when button is clicked 
	- Use the 'EditForm' component
		-  Map with form tag
		- EditForm Model="THE-DATA-MODEL".....EditForm

- Blazor apps are used for Compositional UI Application
	- There could be multiple components loaded on UI ata a time
	- There could be parent parent-child relationship across components
	- The Parent Component will pass data to child component
		- The CHild Component MUST define public property decorated with [Parameter] Attribute class 
			- [Parameter] will be used provide infor to Blazor that the compoennt is ready to accept data
	- The Child COmponent will EMit data to parent Component
		- The Child Component MUST define a property of the type 'EventCallback<T>' which will be decoarated with [Parameter] attribute
			- EventCallback<T> a type that will be used to emit an EVent from CHild to parent so that data from Child will be passed to parent
			- T a Payload Type Parameter that represents type of data emitted from Chilt to parent
- Blazor Navigation across Components
	- Using URL Parameters
		- The Page Directive will be
			- @page "/url/{PARAMETER:DATATYPE}"
				- Possible make the parameter as 'NULLABLE'
				- ON REceiver chacek for the Null COndition
	- Use the 'NavigationManager' class, this is already registered into the Dependency COntainer of the Blazor App 
		- THis class is used to navigate across Components
		- Inject this class in the COmponent using @Inject directive
		- The 'NavigateTo(URL)' method accept URL to Navigate 
	- USing an Application State
		- THis is a class that will have a Variable (or a collection) which will be responsible to share state across components
			- A Variable / A Collection
				- The State Data to ne shared
			- An Event
				- The Event will be raised when the State Data is Updated
			- A Method
				- A Method that will be responsible to update the State Data 
		- THis Application State object MUST be Registered as 'Singleton' objet in DI Container of the Applcation
		- Inject this Service instance in component that wants to REad/Update data from and to Sppliacation State objects
		- The Sender component will set the new State and will also mak sure that the state is changed
		- *** IMP: Make sure that each subscriber component releases the Event in its dispose method (Recommended) 
		
- Router
	- Class for storing a Router Table for the Current Applcation
	- Loads COmpoent classes and their @page directives (aka URLs) into the ROuter Table
	- Found
		- If the Component COrresponding to the Current Requested URL is present or not
		- If yes then Load, instantiate and Render it
	- NotFound
		- Show the Error Message or can also be used for Fallback UI
	- RouteView
		- The Container View where all COmponents in NAvigation will be Loaded and Rendered
	- LayoutComponentBase
		- The base class for Layout
			- ComponentBase, the base class for All Components
		- Body of the type 'RenderFragment'
			- RenderFragment, the delegate that uses the RenderTreeBuilder class that Manages the REndering aka HTML UI generation
- JavaScript Interoperability
	- Microsoft.JSInterop
	- Provides an access of JS to Blazor
	- Exposes C# Code to JS
	- IJSRuntime COntract
		- An interface that is used to integrate the Blzor Object Model with JS Object Model
		- InvokeAsync<T>("METHOD-NAME-FROM-JS", COMMA-SEPARATED-LIST-OF-PARAMETERS-AS-OBJECT-ARRAY)
			- The JS Method returns T
		- InvokeVoidAsync("METHOD-NAME-FROM-JS",COMMA-SEPARATED-LIST-OF-PARAMETERS-AS-OBJECT-ARRAY)
			- Returns Void, call JS Method that does not return anything
		- COMMA-SEPARATED-LIST-OF-PARAMETERS-AS-OBJECT-ARRAY
			- These wille be converted into JSON Object Array
	- JSInvokableAttibute class	
		- This is applied on C# method so that it can be invoked by JS Object
		- [JSInvokable("NAME-OF-JS-OBJECT-METHOD")]
		- window.MyObject = {
		   method1:function(){
		   
		   }
		}
		- window is the object that represents the current active Browser instance
	- DotNet.invokeMethodAsync("CURRENT-ASSEMBLY-THAT-COTAINS-C#-METHOD", "C#-METHOD-NAME")
		- This is Async Call
		- The 'DotNet' object is provided through the blazor.webassembly.js  
		- e.g.
			-  DotNet.invokeMethodAsync().then().catch()
				- .then(), successfull execution
				- .catch(), error
			
- DataAnnotationsValidator
	- Use this componet to load all validations applied on Model class that is BOund with the EditForm
- ValidationSummary
	- USe this component to show error messages 
- Use EditForm for Binding CLR Model to UI so that it can be Submitted
	- Model property
		- USed to Bind the CLR Model instance with UI
		- ALl Children of EditForm will be bound with Model class instance
	- OnValidSubmit property
		- Validate the Model instance  first based on DataAnnotations and then Submit the Form
- If you want to create Razor components using seperate projets then use the RAzor Library and create components in it and refer it in Main Balzor Project
	- USe the LAzy Loading for the Referred Assemblies
		- Download on Demand instaed of earli downloading
		- BlazorWebAssemblyLazyLoad
			- USe it in the Project file to specify the LAzy Loaded Assembly
			- &lt;BlazorWebAssemblyLazyLoad Include="Product_LazyLoad.dll"&gt;&lt;/BlazorWebAssemblyLazyLoad&gt
	- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Services
		- NAmespace for LAzy Load Service
	- LazyAssemblyLoader
		- Class that will inform the Router Component to Lazy Load of assembly

```` html
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly"
        OnNavigateAsync="OnNavigationAsync"
        AdditionalAssemblies="lazyAssemblies">
````
	- THe Router  COmponent will use the additional assemblies  based on the method bind with OnNavigateAsync property of the Router component 
		- NavigationContext: The class tht sets the CUrrent Navigation requested by the Router
